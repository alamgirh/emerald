## Steps:

- Step 1: Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.
  - For example, your GitHub account name is **meghna**.
  - Create a repository, for example, your new repository name is **padma**. For little bit practice to know how GitHub works, you can create a [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Write someting that you like in the README.md file. Go to Settings -> Options. Then you will find GitHub Pages paragraph where you can find a button (Choose a theme). Click the button Choose a theme and Select Theme. Finally, your README.md file will use as a content of your website. Your website address is http://**meghna**.github.io/**padma** . Yes, anyone can view your website and finally you created a website in GitHub!   
  - For writing README.md file you may learn Markdown which is super easy. You may see [Markdown-Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

- Step 2: Want to practice HTML - the key ingredient for creating a website?  
  - Create a repository **meghna**.github.io . Create an index.html file. If you are new HTML user you may find tutorial from [w3schools](http://www.w3schools.com/html/) 

- Step 3: Find a [Jekyll Theme](https://jekyllthemes.io/)

- Step 4: Find the repository in GitHub that theme you have chosen. Fork that repository.
  - Follow the instructions from their readme file.

- Step 5: Edit the file _config.yml according to your information

- Step 6: Write your first blog inside the folder _posts. For example, your new file name is 2016-12-16-My-First-Blog.md . You may use [http://prose.io](http://prose.io), which is more convenient that I found. You may change some other files inside the folder _includes to make your blog more personal from the original theme.

## During this process you need to know the following
- [GitHub for Beginners](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) 
- Basic HTML
- Markdown, a lightweight markup language which is very simle to learn. You may see the [Markdown-Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
- Basic idea about [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
